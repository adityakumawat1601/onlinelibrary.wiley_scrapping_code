44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,"Empirical inquiry without hypotheses: A question-driven, phenomenon-based approach to strategic management research","Melissa E. Graebner, Anne Marie Knott, Marvin B. Lieberman, Will Mitchell","Many advances in strategic management have resulted from the application of formal deductive methods, based on tests of specific hypotheses derived from theory. Nonetheless, numerous important research topics involve phenomena that are novel and/or causally complex and so resist basic hypothetico-deductive logic. As a result, many of the most important findings in strategy research have come from open-ended studies of relevant phenomena. The special issue of the SMJ on “Question-Driven and Phenomenon-Based Empirical Strategy Research” presents innovative ideas for question-driven research and expands the toolkit of research approaches. In this introduction we describe the twelve articles in the special issue, focusing on how they contribute to continued development of the question-driven approach to research in strategic management.","One of the frustrations managers have with academic research is that it tends to be driven by questions that are theoretically interesting or lend themselves to clever econometrics. Accordingly, the results can lack managerial relevance. We highlight research that takes the opposite approach—identifying important business phenomena and devising empirical approaches to characterize them and derive managerial implications. In this introductory article, we briefly summarize the studies in the special issue, showing how they answer a diverse set of questions using a range of methods."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Entry diversion: Deterrence by diverting submarket entry,"Bilgehan Uzunca, Bruno Cassiman","Going back to Bain (1956), strategy scholars have long recognized the importance of deterring entry for sustaining incumbents' profits in an industry. We introduce a new mechanism, entry diversion, to better understand the empirical phenomenon of persistent firm entry in spite of investments in entry deterrence by incumbents in some industries. Entry diversion happens when preemptive strategic investments by incumbents decrease the expected future profits from a target submarket such that entrants choose to enter another submarket within the same industry. Empirical evidence from the global semiconductor manufacturing industry suggests that incumbents expand their capacities beyond demand growth, and that these investments effectively divert entry into other submarkets. Greenfield entrants are more responsive to entry diversion than incumbents.","Managers have long understood that deterring entry of new players into their industry could sustain their firms' profits. In this article, we introduce a new mechanism, entry diversion, where the incumbent diverts potential entrants from its submarket toward other submarkets in the same industry. Entry diversion happens when preemptive strategic investments by incumbents decrease the expected future profits of the entrant in a submarket of the industry such that the entrant chooses not to enter the incumbent's submarket. Contrary to entry deterrence, new players will still enter the industry but settle in different submarkets. Empirical evidence from the global semiconductor manufacturing industry suggests that incumbents expand their capacities beyond demand growth, and that these investments effectively divert entry into other submarkets."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,The firm as an architect of polycentric governance: Building open institutional infrastructure in emerging markets,"Aline Gatignon, Laurence Capron","We apply pattern-matching techniques to contrast qualitative case study data with perspectives from strategic management and institutional economics about how a firm can address voids in market-based institutions. We identify a novel approach whereby the firm builds an open institutional infrastructure (OII) by investing in a pool of resources widely accessible beyond its exchange partners. To collectively govern OII, the firm must empower other actors within multilateral cross-sector partnerships, and it must enforce the resulting rules through relational norms based on alignment between public and private value creation. These findings, achieved by adapting Elinor Ostrom's principles of polycentric governance to corporate actors who take the lead in building OII, advance our understanding of new organizational forms that transcend the traditional boundaries of firms and markets.","Emerging markets typically present additional obstacles for business operations because they lack the necessary underlying institutional infrastructure such as access to capital and labor markets. We introduce a new way for firms to overcome these obstacles—which we call building an OII—by investing in such infrastructure themselves and making it available to their commercial partners, local communities, and even to competitors. Firms must empower those actors to take the lead in collectively defining the rules for accessing this infrastructure, by orchestrating cross-sector partnerships. This process creates relational norms around the alignment of public and private interests, which ultimately can promote firms' competitive advantage."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,The entrepreneurial process: Evidence from a nationally representative survey,"Victor M. Bennett, Aaron K. Chatterji","Scholars have traditionally characterized the variation in firm performance as determined by conditions after entry, where the entry decision is a one-shot binary choice determined by cost–benefit analysis. However, recent theoretical work has posited that the entry decision is an outcome of a learning process and that the information acquired during the pre-entry period shapes subsequent performance dynamics. We provide the first systematic data on the pre-entry period using a nationally representative survey. We document the activities that prospective entrants undertake, finding variation according to opportunity costs, prior experience, and confidence levels. Our results suggest the pre-entry period is shaped by a series of choices by prospective entrants as they contemplate entry, further exploration, or ending the entrepreneurial process.","We created and implemented a nationally representative survey on the entrepreneurial activities of Americans. Several interesting findings emerged. First, approximately a third of Americans report having had a business idea in the past 5 years, motivated in the vast majority of cases by lifestyle concerns rather than the pursuit of significant business opportunities. Fewer than half of those who considered starting a business take even the lowest cost steps, like searching the Internet for potential competitors or speaking with a friend. Our findings reveal an entrepreneurial process which involves a significant pre-entry period where prospective entrepreneurs seek to acquire information about the quality of their idea, perform administrative tasks to prepare for launch and encounter frictions that impede their progress."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,The risk of being ranked: Investor response to marginal inclusion on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list,"Ben W. Lewis, W. Chad Carlos","Despite the proliferation of lists and rankings that recognize firms for superior performance, empirical studies have been limited in their ability to causally evaluate how inclusion for the marginal firm influences shareholder value. We address this limitation by examining how investors responded to firms that were barely included or excluded from the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list. Contrary to prevailing theoretical expectations, our findings indicate that marginal firms that were included in the ranking experienced negative abnormal returns compared to marginal firms that were excluded. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and how they inspire future research questions for scholarship on rankings and status. We also discuss implications for managers that question whether and when being ranked results in financial benefits or liabilities.","Because being ranked is generally seen as an important strategic objective for companies, managers must carefully consider how much attention and resources to allocate toward this pursuit. Although existing research suggests that being ranked can be beneficial, we have a limited understanding about whether barely making a ranked list is worth the effort. We provide new insights for managers by showing that investors not only respond negatively to marginal inclusion on a ranking but also provide suggestions for how companies might counteract this effect. Specifically, our results suggest that making consistent, focused investments that are relevant to external stakeholders may buffer organizations from the potential negative effects of marginal inclusion on a ranking. These insights may also inspire managers to reconsider their firms' commitments to being ranked."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Entrepreneurial teams' acquisition of talent: Evidence from technology manufacturing industries using a two-sided approach,"Florence Honoré, Martin Ganco","One of the established findings in the spinout literature is that founders with prior industry experience assemble larger entrepreneurial teams and create better-performing startups. We examine the role of prior industry experience in the startups' next stage—its hiring of new employees. We tackle two empirical challenges—the mutual aspect of hiring and the effect of unobserved variables on employees' earnings using a two-sided matching model. Our results reveal that even firms founded by entrepreneurs without industry experience can attract new employees with such experience if the founders start with a large entrepreneurial team. Further, startups provide new hires with an earnings premium for their industry experience. Our approach illustrates the benefits of matching models over traditional regressions.","Growing startups face the question of who to hire and how much to compensate the new hires. Simultaneously, prospective new hires ask which startup to join and how much their salary will be. We explore these questions using a novel method that tackles the mutual selection process. In the context of five technological manufacturing industries, we find that having industry experience within founding teams may not be necessary to attract new hires with high quality if the startup can signal its own quality through other means such as having a larger founding team. Our results indicate that startups prefer employees with industry experience for which startups offer a wage premium. Thus, employees seeking startup employment benefit from gaining industry experience prior to joining a startup."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,The performance effects of creative imitation on original products: Evidence from lab and field experiments,"Liangyan Wang, Brian Wu, Cornelia Pechmann, Yitong Wang","A market entrant often challenges the incumbent using creative imitation: The entrant creatively combines imitated aspects of the original with its own innovative characteristics to create a distinct offering. Using lab and field experiments to examine creative imitation in China, we find the effects of creative imitations on the originals depend on the creative imitation's quality. We explore the underlying mechanisms, and show that including a low-quality creative imitation in the retail choice set increases satisfaction with and choice of the original, while a moderate-quality creative imitation does the opposite. Moreover, creative imitation affects consumers' satisfaction with the original by influencing whether their experience with the original verifies their expectations. Our paper reveals creative imitation effects to help incumbent firms effectively address them.","When the incumbent is challenged by an entrant using creative imitation, consumers may react differently to the incumbent, and understanding consumers' reactions allows the incumbent to make better strategic decisions about how to address the challenge. Using lab and field experiments, we investigate creative imitations with two quality levels common in our empirical context, low quality and moderate quality, and examine how and why they differentially affect the originals. We find the presence of a low-quality creative imitation actually increased choice of the original by enhancing consumers' satisfaction with it, while a moderate-quality creative imitation reduced choice of the original by undermining satisfaction with it. Our research suggests the incumbent should address moderate-quality creative imitations' challenges to customer satisfaction, while temporarily tolerating low-quality creative imitations."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,What is a pivot? Explaining when and how entrepreneurial firms decide to make strategic change and pivot,"Jacqueline Kirtley, Siobhan O'Mahony","Most theories of strategic change focus on how large, established firms recognize or fail to recognize the need for strategic change. Little research examines how early-stage entrepreneurs decide when and how to change their strategies. With a longitudinal field study of seven entrepreneurial firms developing innovations in energy and cleantech, we examined 93 strategic decisions at risk for change. We found that decision-makers chose to change their strategies only after new information conflicted with or expanded their beliefs. Furthermore, a pivot, or strategic reorientation, was not achieved with a single decision, but by incrementally exiting or adding strategy elements over time, accumulating into a pivot. We contribute a grounded definition of what constitutes a pivot and explain when and how entrepreneurial firms pivot.","The term “pivot” is used extensively by practitioners and scholars alike, yet little is known about when and how entrepreneurial firms actually choose to change their strategies and when that change constitutes a pivot. We find that entrepreneurial firms choose to change their strategies only after receiving new information that conflicts with or expands their beliefs about their firm or uncertainties they face. However, this is more rare than the norm. Rather than make wholesale change with one decision, firms incrementally exit or add a single element to their strategies. A firm pivots and reorients their strategic direction by reallocating or restructuring the firm's activities, resources, and attention through an accumulated series of decisions to address the on-going stream of problems and opportunities early-stage firms confront."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,"Are U.S. firms becoming more short-term oriented? Evidence of shifting firm time horizons from implied discount rates, 1980–2013","Rachelle C. Sampson, Yuan Shi","We provide evidence that investors in U.S. public markets are increasingly discounting firms' expected future cash flows during 1980–2013. This trend is shown not only on average across firms, but also within firms over time after alternative explanations are accounted for. To corroborate a link with firm time horizons, we estimate the relationship between an implied discount rate (“IDR”) and factors relevant to firm long-term strategy. We find that IDR is correlated in expected ways with firm investments, management incentives, financial health, ownership, and external pressures—measures that have been argued to correlate with firm time horizons. This article represents one of the first attempts to document market-wide evidence of shortening firm time horizons. These changing horizons bear important implications for firm strategy.","Whether U.S. firms have become more short-term oriented remains an active debate among managers, investors, researchers, and policymakers. In this study, we report that investors have been increasingly discounting the expected future returns of public firms over the last three decades. We find that a firm's discounting rate is explained by signals of its long-term strategy, including investment decisions, ownership structure, financial health, executive compensation scheme, and short-term pressures from the external environment. Our findings indicate a market-wide contraction of firm time horizons, highlighting firm characteristics that suggest how and why firms differ in their time horizons. These demonstrated relationships may help guide firms in devising investment strategies as well as external communications to attract investors that share a firm's preferred time horizon."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Changing the channel: Digitization and the rise of “middle tail” strategies,"Mary J. Benner, Joel Waldfogel","Prior research has studied whether digitization shifts demand away from mass-appeal blockbusters toward a “long tail” of existing products. We extend this work by studying whether digitization influences the products created. Using unique data on movies, we examine whether the reduced costs of production and new digital distribution channels spur producers to create products aimed at smaller audiences. We employ a flexible, transparent, and largely graphical empirical approach to document changes unfolding with digitization. We find growth in both intended blockbuster and long tail products, but also, the rise of a “middle tail,” movies distributed via digital channels, with budgets suggesting commercial intent but well below the averages for theatrical distribution. The new middle tail is largely due to newcomers rather than major incumbents.","Digitization has reduced the costs to create movies, while also enabling new distribution channels that avoid the high costs of theatrical distribution. With lower costs, movies no longer need to be “blockbusters” at the box office to be financially successful. In this article, we study whether digitization has spurred an increase in lower-budget movies that are not aimed for release in theaters. We find that digitization has unleashed a large number of very low budget movies that attract little commercial attention (i.e., the “long tail”). However, we also find an increase in a new category of movies with budgets between $100,000 and $10 million, aimed at smaller audiences via new digital distribution channels. We show growth in this “middle tail” following digitization."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,"Bad bets: Nonlinear incentives, risk, and performance","Rui J. P. de Figueiredo Jr., Evan Rawley, Orie Shelef","This article examines the consequences of incentive slope and shape on performance and risk-taking. It focuses on how slope—incentive intensity—influences risk-taking, and how shape—nonlinearity—influences performance. We use quasi-random variation in the context of the hedge-fund industry to separate slope and shape effects. Our results demonstrate that shape has large and important effects on performance, and that slope affects risk-taking. The evidence suggests that poor performance in the industry is often due to bad bets—excessive risk-taking that reduces performance—taken in response to nonlinear incentives. The findings suggest that, although nonlinear incentives are widely used, they can, under certain circumstances, predictably produce pernicious effects on organizational performance.","This article examines how nonlinear incentive contracts—such as contracts that reward performance above a threshold substantially more than below it—influence managerial behavior. Using the hedge-fund industry, in which nonlinear incentives are ubiquitous, as a laboratory, we find that nonlinear incentive schemes cause managers who are “close” to, but below, the performance threshold to take bad bets—excessive risk-taking that reduces performance. The findings suggest that, although nonlinear incentives are widely used, they can, under certain circumstances, predictably produce pernicious effects on organizational performance."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Whom should a leader imitate? Using rivalry-based imitation to manage strategic risk in changing environments,"Dmitry Sharapov, Jan-Michael Ross","We study the performance implications of dynamic environments for a leader's rivalry-based imitation efforts in a setting with multiple rivals. We disentangle competitive interactions from environmental changes to show that a leader's simple rules to either imitate the closest rival in terms of attributes (her neighbor) or the closest rival in terms of rank (her challenger) can help to maintain the performance gap to her competitors. Using a computational model and an empirical test, we find that environmental changes alter the trade-offs between imitation accuracy and the responsiveness to threats from distant rivals. Consequently, when environmental changes are infrequent and minor, neighbor imitation is more effective in maintaining the lead, whereas challenger imitation prevails as environmental changes become more frequent and substantial.","By showing that imitating a lower-ranked rival can help a leader to stay ahead, recent research has overturned the common thinking that imitation is only useful for those trying to catch up with the leader. However, these insights come from contexts in which the leader has only one competitor. Can imitation also be effective for a leader competing against multiple rivals, and whom should the leader imitate? We find that imitation can indeed help the leader to maintain their lead against multiple rivals, but that the choice of imitation target matters and should take the competitive environment into account. In relatively stable environments, imitating your most similar rival works best, while imitating whoever is in second place is a more effective approach in changeable environments."
44,1,January,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,The effects of strategy and institutions on value creation and appropriation in firms: A longitudinal study of three telecom companies,"Philipp Kern, Howard Gospel","Strategic management has come to pay more attention to value creation and appropriation (VCA) among the firm's stakeholders, including customers, capital owners, and employees. Existing research has conceptualized this as a strategic choice bounded by the bargaining power of each stakeholder group, which, we argue, risks misattributing outcomes by neglecting structural constraints. Instead, these dynamics need to be understood within the wider institutional context shaping the behavior of managers and stakeholders. Using a question-driven mixed-methods approach, we investigate the evolution of VCA in three telecom companies located in different institutional systems—British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, and Telecom Italia. Our findings suggest that national institutional and firm strategic effects must be considered together to understand patterns of VCA among stakeholders.","Using an emerging methodology, we quantify how three telecom firms (British Telecom, Deutsche Telecom, and Telecom Italia) have created and distributed economic value since privatization. Our focus is on explaining the extent to which various stakeholders—employees, customers, capital owners, and government—were able to appropriate the value created by the firms. Some similarities are found across the three companies, but we also found major differences. To explain patterns, we bring together (a) strategic decision making by managers within the firm and (b) constraints imposed by institutions outside the firm. We find both to be important, interlinked drivers of distributional patterns. The article gives managers and stakeholders a means to understand major changes and determinants of value creation and distribution."

44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Managerial political power and the reallocation of resources in the internal capital market,Dongil Daniel Keum,"We examine how managers' political power reallocates resources in the internal capital market. By shifting the focus from financial to firm-specific, non-financial resources that are difficult to evaluate and zero-sum in nature, we revise the prevailing view that managers' political power plays a significant yet contingent role under financial constraint and weak governance. We instead characterize managerial political power as an intrinsic, inescapable determinant of internal competition and resource allocation. Our research design links sentence-by-sentence, qualitative analyses of the legal opinion delivered as breaking news during the corruption trials involving a key executive at Samsung group with minute-level shifts in share prices. This study presents a politics-based theory of the internal capital market and highlights the methodological potential of quantitative case studies.","Managerial politics presents a vexing yet persistent reality of organizational life and the inter-divisional competition for resources. We attribute its pervasiveness to the contest over non-financial resources with fuzzy ownership and significant yet uncertain value, such as bargaining power over internal transfer pricing, managerial attention, and control over new business opportunities. Because of the zero-sum dynamics of these non-financial resources and their constant scarcity, political contests cannot be suppressed through the provision of financial slack or agency controls and even extend to family members. Appointing rival managers along clearly separated lines of businesses may curb, but not eliminate, managerial politics. We show that investors are acutely aware of the value of managers' political power and make investment decisions based on them."
44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Standing on the parent's shoulder or in its shadow? Alliance partner overlap between employee spinouts and their parents,"Shweta Gaonkar, Mahka Moeen","Employee spinouts, defined as startups founded by prior employees of an industry firm, play a critical role in firm creation and knowledge transfer. Their superior performance often arises from resources and knowledge accrued during employment in parent firms. An understudied question is whether prior employment in parent firms affects an employee spinout's alliance formation, given that alliances are critical to startups' survival and commercial success. This article examines when an employee spinout's alliance partners overlap with the parent's partners. Drawing on alliance formation patterns of U.S. medical device spinouts founded between 1990 and 2013, we find that spinouts building on their parents' technologies tend to have a greater partner overlap with their parents, whereas product market overlap leads to fewer overlapping partners.","A rich context for entrepreneurs to identify new opportunities is through their employment in existing industry firms. When employees leave their job and create a spinout, their employment experience often provides them superior knowledge and expertise. Our study of medical device startups uncovers another distinctive feature of employee spinouts, that is, access to their employer's alliance partners. However, for such opportunities to come to fruition, entrepreneurs need to pay attention to their technical and product market positioning relative to their past employers. When spinouts build on their employer's technologies without challenging them in the product space, they can leverage connections to their employer's partners. This alliance strategy may free spinouts from the alliance formation struggles faced by resource-deficient startups."
44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Online communities on competing platforms: Evidence from game wikis,"Johannes Loh,
 Tobias Kretschmer","Many platforms rely on volunteer contributions for value creation. Thus, unpaid contributors are valuable to the platform, but control over their activities is limited. We study whether and how volunteer communities can provide a competitive advantage and ask how contributor behavior depends on a platform's competitive position. We propose two channels: First, a stronger competitive position facilitates contributor coordination, leading to a larger active community. Second, a platform's competitive position is related to contributor motivation, which drives how much individuals contribute. Studying two competing game wiki platforms, we find that a platform's stronger competitive position is associated with higher activity, primarily driven by the number of contributors, which in turn triggers increased contributions by existing contributors. Further, high-productivity contributors are especially active on a stronger platform.","Online “crowdsourcing” communities create value for many digital platforms, but managing them in a way that ensures productive contributions is challenging. To better understand the conditions under which online communities create value productively we analyze how contribution patterns differ between more and less successful platforms. We study 13 game wiki communities on two competing platforms and find that success is tied to higher activity, which is in turn the result of more manpower in the value creation process, but also higher productivity by individual contributors. In addition, a dedicated core of highly productive community members is an important driver of platform success. These findings have implications for the motivation of community members, and the entry and growth strategies of crowdsourced platforms."
44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,"Changes in industry and corporate effects in the United States, 1978–2019",Ming zhu Wang,"I present evidence of a shift in the relative contributions of industry and corporate effects to heterogeneity in business performance in the United States. In a systematic analysis of sequential timeframes between 1978 and 2019, I find a persistent rise in the explanatory power of corporate effects, which has grown to surpass that of industry effects. Consistent with these trends, I also find that an increasing share of multi-business firms is operating only high-performing or only low-performing businesses, which coincides with refocusing efforts that began in the 1980s. This temporal perspective provides an explanation for why prior studies estimating industry and corporate effects have reached different conclusions.","I present evidence that how much industry and corporate parentage each matter to business performance among diversified firms in the United States has changed over time in a systematic way. Specifically, my analyses show that while factors at the industry level may have mattered more than those at the corporate level from the late 1970s through most of the 1990s, this has since reversed and corporate parentage likely explained more of business profitability throughout the 2000s and 2010s than industry membership. These changes coincide with a trend that began in the 1980s toward greater focus and relatedness among the operations of diversified firms."
44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Using supervised machine learning for large-scale classification in management research: The case for identifying artificial intelligence patents,"Milan Miric, Nan Jia, Kenneth G. Huang","Researchers increasingly use unstructured text data to construct quantitative variables for analysis. This goal has traditionally been achieved using keyword-based approaches, which require researchers to specify a dictionary of keywords mapped to the theoretical concepts of interest. However, recent machine learning (ML) tools for text classification and natural language processing can be used to construct quantitative variables and to classify unstructured text documents. In this paper, we demonstrate how to employ ML tools for this purpose and discuss one application for identifying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in patents. We compare and contrast various ML methods with the keyword-based approach, demonstrating the advantages of the ML approach. We also leverage the classification outcomes generated by ML models to demonstrate general patterns of AI technological innovation development.","Text-based documents offer a wealth of information for researchers and business analysts. However, researchers often need to find a way to classify these documents to use in subsequent research projects. In this paper, we demonstrate how supervised ML methods can be used to automate the process of classifying textual documents into pre-defined categories or groups. We provide an overview of when such techniques may be used in comparison to other methods, and the considerations and tradeoffs associated with each method. We apply these methods to identify AI-based technologies from all patents in the United States, based on patent abstract text. This allows us to show interesting patterns of AI innovation development in the United States. We also provide the code and data used in this paper for future research."
44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Dynamic capabilities and governance: An empirical investigation of financial performance of the higher education sector,"Sohvi Heaton, David Teece, Eugene Agronin","We postulate that resource allocation decisions consistent with dynamic capabilities can improve financial performance, but that governance moderates the relationship between resource allocation flexibility and financial performance. Using more than a decade of data on US public universities, we find that flexibility has much more impact when matched by lower levels of governance that allow greater expenditure autonomy for university executives and administrators.","Organizations are increasingly subject to conflicting demands imposed by their institutional environments. Given the importance of governance arrangements, we apply strategic management concepts to public universities and investigate the effect of external governance arrangements on university performance. We show that universities that reallocate resources more regularly are more likely to run larger budget surpluses. This is far more likely to be true at universities where external governance arrangements allow greater executive discretion."
44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Do ambitious entrepreneurs benefit more from training?,"Reddi Kotha, Balagopal (Bala) Vissa, Yimin Lin, Anne-Valérie Corboz","Does growth training help entrepreneurs scale-up new ventures? Our field experiment answers this question using data from 181 Singapore-based, early-growth entrepreneurs drawn from a broad range of industry sectors. Treatment content focused on three growth-catalyst tools relevant for formulating and executing innovation-led growth: business-model design, leveraging external networks, and building internal teams. Treatment format comprised interactive lecture sessions and workshops on these tools supplemented by personalized coaching in applying the tools to entrepreneurs' specific challenges. We find that ventures led by entrepreneurs that received training experienced sales growth of 72.5% compared to 30.3% for those in the control condition. Furthermore, ventures led by entrepreneurs with more ambitious growth expectations experienced sales growth of about 100% compared to 10% for those in the control condition.","We study how training in growth-catalyst tools help entrepreneurs scale-up new ventures. We focused on three tools relevant for formulating and executing innovation-led growth: business-model design, leveraging external networks, and building internal teams. The training format comprised lecture workshops and personalized coaching in applying the tools. Our quantitative findings confirm that entrepreneurs who attended the training increased their venture's sales revenue, and the more ambitious entrepreneurs increased their venture's sales revenue to a much greater degree. Illustrative interviews suggest these tools help entrepreneurs to reimagine their business, successfully access influential resource-holders such as potential investors or customers, and persuade them by representing their business in a credible and succinct fashion. Our findings inform policymakers designing entrepreneurial training interventions on how participants' ambitions shapes intervention success."
44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,The option value in complements within platform-based ecosystems,"Puay Khoon Toh, Shiva Agarwal","Within platform-based ecosystems, what drives platform owners' investment decision to enable third-party complements onto their platforms? Departing from the conventional focus on the complementarity value that these complements add to platform owners, we examine how uncertainty in the complementary product market drives this decision. We offer a novel perspective on third-party complements—they contain option value allowing the platform owner to defer its own entry into the market. Thus, uncertainty increases investment in enabling complements, especially with greater “downside risk” in the market or learning-by-observing. We demonstrate this perspective using numerical examples, simulations, and data on Apple's iPhone ecosystem from 2010 to 2015. This perspective brings together literatures on complementarity value and entry into the complementary market, and indicates that complements generate more than complementarity value within platform-based ecosystems.","To manage complements within a platform-based ecosystem, the platform owner needs to understand how complements add value. Conventionally, complements are seen to render the platform more attractive. We offer a different view—complements can be seen as real options for the platform owner to learn about the product-market potential and decide later if it should enter the market with its own product. Using data from Apple's iPhone ecosystem, we demonstrate this option value and show that it is salient when “downside risk” of the market is high or learning-by-observing is possible. Our analysis suggests that without considering such option value, platform managers may have underestimated the value-add of complements on their platforms. Our findings also contribute to recent discussions about platform owners' entry into third-party spaces."
44,2,February,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Multi-project work and project performance: Friends or foes?,"Anatoli Colicev, Tuuli Hakkarainen, Torben Pedersen","While multi-project work (MPW) is becoming an increasingly popular work arrangement, its relationship with project performance is understudied. On the one hand, MPW is deployed to increase employee worktime utilization and productivity, which should be reflected in more timely project completion. On the other hand, MPW also brings switching costs due to attention residue and cognitive setup. Based on this trade-off, we derive an inverted U-shaped relationship between MPW and project performance. We find support for this relationship in a longitudinal dataset containing 9,649 project-month-employee observations. More specialized experience, project similarity, and employee familiarity positively moderate the inverted U-shape. Furthermore, the results are robust to a host of model specifications, data structures, assumptions, and alternative explanations.","How many projects can you work on simultaneously? We study this question in the context of new product development (NPD) projects in a multinational organization. We suggest that multi-project work (MPW) might be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, MPW academics or engineers can be more productive by filling the gaps in their schedules and developing time management practices. On the other hand, MPW also carries switching costs. This trade-off creates an inverted U-shaped relationship between MPW and project performance. So, how can MPW be more beneficial or less costly? We find that more specialized employees can benefit more from productivity gains while working with familiar members or similar projects can alleviate switching costs."

44,3,March,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Does imitation increase or decrease demand for an original product? Understanding the opposing effects of discovery and substitution,"Erdem Dogukan Yilmaz, Ivana Naumovska, Milan Miric","This article studies how the entry of an imitative product influences the demand for the original, in markets with a large number of products where consumers are not aware of most products. We suggest that the release of an imitative product triggers two countervailing forces: a discovery effect that increases awareness and demand for the original, and a substitution effect decreasing that demand. When the imitation is horizontally differentiated, the substitution effect is weaker, and the discovery effect leads to increased demand for the original, particularly so when the original is less well-known. However, when the imitation is vertically differentiated, the discovery effect does not benefit the original, and the demand decreases given the substitution effect. We test our theory in the context of 3D-printable products.","Imitative products typically harm the performance of the original product. This is in part the rationale for deterring imitation by acquiring intellectual property (IP) rights. However, as we demonstrate, the release of an imitative product may increase discovery of the original product, and therefore demand for it. In markets with a large number of products, products typically compete for attention, and an imitative product may serve as a channel through which attention spills over from the imitation to the original. This effect is more pronounced when the original product is less well-known. This suggests that, under certain conditions, firms may benefit from pursuing a more open IP strategy that encourages imitation.

Poliquin","CEOs increasingly engage in activism on controversial social and political issues that do not directly affect their core business. Simultaneously, the general public is increasingly politically polarized. We examine how CEOs' support for gun control after two mass shootings differentially affected the behavior of liberal and conservative consumers and the persistence of these effects. Using mobile phone location data to measure store-level visits, we find (a) consumer visits to stores decreased by 3%; (b) this decrease was asymmetric: visits in the most conservative counties decreased by about 5% but did not change in the most liberal counties; and (c) these effects dissipated within 10 weeks after activism. Our results highlight the strategic implications for executives pressured to take stances on controversial issues.","We study how consumers respond to CEO support for gun control, and how consumers' partisan views influence their behavior. Visits to the stores of several major retailers declined about 3% in the 4 weeks after their CEOs supported expanding background checks for gun purchases. In the most liberal counties, visits did not change following CEO support for gun control, while in the most conservative counties visits declined about 5%. Hence, the reaction of liberal consumers did not counteract the reaction of conservative consumers. We find, however, that these effects dissipated within 10 weeks; as a result, retailers whose CEOs supported gun control did not experience any long-term, net decrease in sales despite the short-term sales decrease in conservative counties."
44,3,March,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Peering into a crystal ball: Forecasting behavior and industry foresight,"Rahul Kapoor, Daniel Wilde","What makes some managers and entrepreneurs better at forecasting the industry context than others? We argue that, regardless of experience or expertise, a learning-based forecasting behavior in which individuals attend to and incorporate new relevant information from the environment into an updated belief that aligns with the Bayesian belief updating process is likely to generate superior industry foresight. However, the effectiveness of such a cognitively demanding process diminishes under high levels of uncertainty. We find support for these arguments using an experimental design of forecasting tournaments in the managerially relevant context of the global automotive industry from 2016 to 2019. The study provides a novel account of individual-level forecasting behavior and its effectiveness in an evolving industry and suggests important implications for managers and entrepreneurs.","How a focal industry will evolve is a key forecasting problem faced by managers and entrepreneurs as they seek to identify opportunities and make strategic decisions. However, developing superior industry foresight in the face of significant change, and limited and often contradictory information, can be especially challenging. We study how individuals forecast the ongoing transformation of the global automotive industry with respect to electrification and autonomy, using a novel research design of forecasting tournaments. A forecasting process in which individuals update their beliefs by neither ignoring prior information nor overacting to new information helps to generate superior industry foresight. There was a significant penalty to forecasting accuracy when individuals did not update their beliefs at all, or when they updated, but overreacted to new information."
44,3,March,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Going beyond optimal distinctiveness: Strategic positioning for gaining an audience composition premium,"Majid Majzoubi, Eric Yanfei Zhao","A core question in strategy research is how firms should position themselves to gain favorable audience evaluations. Emphasizing the heterogeneity in audience predispositions, we propose that firms can gain an audience composition premium by strategically positioning themselves to gain more (less) attention from audiences with positive (negative) predispositions toward them. We argue that this approach to strategic positioning is more conducive for firms with high dispersion in their audience predispositions and that firms can increase their ability to gain an audience composition premium by engaging with audiences holding moderately diverse evaluative schemas. We employ recommender systems and topic modeling to analyze 152,312 firm-analyst-year observations from 1997 to 2018 and 297,931 earnings call transcripts of U.S. public firms and find strong support for our predictions.","A key question managers encounter is how to increase their firms' evaluations from external evaluators such as security analysts. In this study, we show that firms can increase their aggregate analyst recommendations by influencing the composition of analysts who opt to cover them and gaining evaluations from analysts who have more favorable predispositions toward them (i.e., by gaining an audience composition premium). Our findings also suggest that gaining an audience composition premium is more important for enhancing a firm's aggregate analyst recommendations when there is a higher dispersion in analyst predispositions toward the firm. To increase its ability to gain an audience composition premium, the firm should engage with analysts who exhibit a moderate degree of heterogeneity in their evaluative schemas."
44,3,March,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Collaborations that hurt firm performance but help employees’ careers,"Henning Piezunka, Thorsten Grohsjean","When a firm and a competitor collaborate with the same partner, they compete for the shared partner's resources and attention. Such “peer competition” has been shown to negatively affect a firm's access to resources and its performance. One might expect that also the employees’ careers to suffer as a result. However, we argue that the firm's employees benefit from such collaborations. They leverage these collaborations to build social capital—helping their mobility and careers. We find empirical support for our theory using a large sample dataset of video game companies. Our study points to an important yet hitherto neglected agency conflict: employees seek interfirm collaborations that benefit them personally but hurt their firm.","We show that some alliances can be detrimental to a firm's performance yet can benefit its employees. Specifically, we find that collaborating with the same partner as a competing firm hurts firm performance but can be leveraged by employees to advance their careers—by using the opportunity to connect with competing firms and find better job opportunities. We also find that firms often take on more collaboration than is good for them but entering many collaborations can benefit employees. Our study shows that the interests of firms and their employees are not always aligned when it comes to interfirm collaborations."
44,3,March,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Precarious situations: A prelude to hiring more hubristic chief executive officers,"Aaron D. Hill, Tessa Recendes, Yuting Yang","We build upon evidence suggesting the precariousness of the situation organizations face when trying to fill chief executive officer (CEO) openings affects both which executives seek and accept such positions and which executives are sought and endorsed by those tasked with hiring. We argue that while more precarious situations likely deter some executives from pursuing and/or accepting such opportunities, more hubristic executives' tendencies make them likely to do so despite the associated challenges. Concordantly, those tasked with filling CEO openings likely view more hubristic executives as particularly important for combatting the challenges of more precarious situations, leading them to seek and endorse such executives. Using multiple conceptualizations of precarious situations, we find support for our arguments in a sample of CEO changes in S&P 500 firms.","Why do organizations select more hubristic executives to fill CEO openings? We answer this question by highlighting the role that situational precariousness plays. Specifically, not all CEO openings are equally attractive to prospective CEOs and not all prospective CEOs are equally attractive to decision makers tasked with filling such openings. We argue and find support for the notion that more hubristic executives' tendencies make them more likely to pursue and accept CEO opportunities at organizations in more precarious situations while those tasked with filling CEO openings likewise believe more hubristic executives' tendencies are particularly important given the precarious situations those organizations face. Our findings advance knowledge of CEO hubris and provide insights for practice."
44,3,March,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,The future of the web? The coordination and early-stage growth of decentralized platforms,"Ying-Ying Hsieh, Jean-Philippe Vergne","This abductive study investigates how management occurs without managerial authority as part of a previously unseen organizational form—the decentralized platform with an independent market value. Our mixed-methods study of the cryptocurrency industry draws on fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (QCA) to analyze archival and interview data and offer new theory on how decentralized platforms coordinate activities to grow in an early-stage, before network effects kick in. We find that, in the absence of a central authority, platforms coordinate activities with three mechanisms, namely decentralized (a) algorithmic coordination, (b) social coordination, and (c) goal coordination. Our QCA treat these mechanisms as explanatory conditions and, using a representative sample of 20 cryptocurrency platforms, reveal which configurations of decentralized coordination mechanisms nurture, or hinder, early-stage platform growth.","Firms operate around a managerial hierarchy that distributes tasks, resources, information, and rewards to organizational members who pursue common goals as contract-bound employees. From 2009, a new organizational form, called the “decentralized platform,” emerged and diffused without relying on hierarchy nor managerial authority—and without having to employ anyone. The most prominent decentralized platform, Bitcoin, has millions of users, thousands of contributors, and a market valuation never achieved before by an organization without a CEO nor shareholders. This study explicates how this unprecedented level of organizational decentralization functions in practice. We foreshadow implications for the digital economy, wherein “Web3” innovations, such as non-fungible tokens and DAOs, have already shifted the orchestrating role played by platforms in capitalist societies."
44,3,March,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Revisiting managerial “style”: The replicability and falsifiability of manager fixed effects for firm policies,"Victor Esteban Jarosiewicz, David Gaddis Ross","We attempt to replicate Bertrand and Schoar (2003), who used manager fixed effects to provide evidence for managerial “style” as measured by metrics such as leverage, R&D spending, and Tobin's Q. We find that the statistical and economic significance of manager fixed effects is generally lower in our results than in theirs. This discrepancy motivated us to conduct placebo tests in which we randomize managers' spells at their firms. The results with the randomized data are generally as strong as those with the real data, suggesting (a) that the apparent explanatory power of manager fixed effects may be largely a statistical artifact and (b) that managerial “style” may manifest itself in more complex ways than can be ascertained from examining financial statement metrics.","An influential body of research uses large datasets of firm financial information to study whether individual top managers have a “style” as measured by metrics such as leverage and R&D spending. We attempt to replicate a leading paper in this body of research but obtain quite different, usually weaker results. We also try repeating the analysis using artificial datasets where managers are randomly assigned to firms other than those at which they really worked. These randomized datasets produce results that are generally as strong as those with the real data. The implications are that the statistical methodology used in this body of research may be generating spurious results and that managerial “style” may be too complex to ascertain from examining financial statement metrics."
44,3,March,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Academic stars and licensing experience in university technology commercialization,"David H. Hsu, Jeffrey M. Kuhn","We examine the process by which university technology transfer offices (TTOs) allocate internal resources, which provides insight into technologies offered for commercialization to the private sector. Using detailed administrative records of patenting decisions and outcomes by one prominent U.S. research-based university's TTO over a 30-year period, we analyze the performance of invention disclosures by academic stars and by inventors with prior licensing experience. We find that the lead inventor's academic prominence (but not licensing experience) predicts patent application filing, while licensing experience (but not academic prominence) predicts patent impact and commercialization success. We supplement this descriptive analysis with follow-up interviews and empirical evaluation of possible mechanisms for this seemingly outsized role of academic stars.","Increasingly prevalent hybrid organizations are expected to fulfill multiple objectives. University technology transfer offices (TTOs) are an example of a hybrid organization and are charged with disseminating academia-originated technology for the public good as well as for economic benefit. We study how one TTO allocates internal resources, using comprehensive in-house administrative data over a 30-year span. We find that while the TTO tends to put resources behind inventions by academic stars, the commercial returns from licensing inventions from such individuals are no different than inventions by non-stars. By contrast, inventors' prior licensing experience highly predicts commercial returns. These results illustrate the challenges inherent in internal resource allocation inside a complex hybrid organization."

44,4,April,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Trade-offs to using standardized tools: Innovation enablers or creativity constraints?,"Milan Miric, Hakan Ozalp, Erdem Dogukan Yilmaz","In platform ecosystems, the creation of new products is often based on standardized development tools. Complementors often have a choice between either using these tools or creating the functionality themselves. In this paper, we study how the use of standardized development tools is related to the type of products created. By using data on the use of middleware (e.g., game engines) in the console video game market, we show that the use of development tools is associated with products that are less novel but with higher sales on average. We exploit a policy change that affected the ability of U.S.-based developers to hire foreign workers as an instrument for the use of development tools and find further support for these patterns.","When developing new products, firms often have to decide whether they base their technology on preexisting components and standardized tools or develop that technology themselves. In general, it has not been clear how using standardized third-party tools that may be available to all firms in an industry affects the nature of the products that are created. Using data on middleware components, such as game engines, in the console video game industry, this paper shows the use of such standardized tools is associated with the creation of products that are less novel but generate higher sales on average. This is an important strategic consideration for firms, but also for platforms that make decisions regarding whether such tools should be allowed on their platform."
44,4,April,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,"Innovation and profitability following antitrust intervention against a dominant platform: The wild, wild west?","Sruthi Thatchenkery, Riitta Katila","This study examines whether “unblocking” competition through antitrust intervention against a dominant platform can spur complementor innovation in platform ecosystems. Using a novel dataset on enterprise infrastructure software and a difference-in-differences design, we examine the relation between the U.S. antitrust intervention against Microsoft (dominant enterprise platform) and subsequent innovation and profitability of infrastructure applications firms (complementors). The data show that innovation among complementors—particularly ones with low market share—soared when the competitive pressure on the dominant platform amplified. However, the profitability of these complementors dropped. Our results contribute to understanding links between competition and innovation in platform ecosystems, as well as the opportunities and threats related to dominant platforms in those ecosystems.","Complementors (apps, services) that are owned by their platforms often have an unfair advantage. Antitrust action challenges the power of such dual platform-complementors, reasoning that unfair advantage blocks fair competition, and, in turn, reduces firms' incentives to innovate and thus limits consumer choice. We examine whether reducing anticompetitive barriers and platform-complementors' power revitalizes the platform ecosystem. Using a landmark antitrust case, we find mixed results: while complementors do innovate more, their profits go down. In particular, the low-share complementors that bring in the most innovation are also the ones that lose the most financially, suggesting that they may have over-relied on the platform for key assets. To develop a healthy ecosystem in the long run, platform owners may want to resist the temptation to keep complementors weak and instead help support their development to stand on their own."
44,4,April,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,When stronger patent law reduces patenting: Empirical evidence,"Yun Hou, I.P.L. Png, Xi Xiong","Theoretically, stronger legal protection affects strategic portfolios in two ways. As each patent becomes more effective, the gain from multiple patents would be less, reducing the demand for patents (negative inframarginal effect). With the effective price of patent protection being lower, the demand for protection and patents would increase (positive marginal effect). The net effect is more likely to be negative in complex technology industries, and magnified by patent ownership fragmentation, manufacturing assets, technological competition, and size. Exploiting variation in the shift in patent law due to the Federal Circuit Appeals Court (CAFC), we find that the average increase in patent protection due to the CAFC led businesses to reduce strategic patenting by 23.3%, and the contingent effects accorded with the hypotheses.","How should businesses adjust patent portfolios to changes in the legal protection of patents? As each patent becomes more effective, the gain from multiple patents would be less, reducing the demand for patents. With the effective price of patent protection being lower, the demand for protection and patents would increase. The net effect is more likely to be negative where the stakes (costs of holdup or gain from exclusivity) are larger. Empirical evidence from strategic patenting by U.S. manufacturing businesses between 1986 and 1992 before and after changes in patent law due to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit supports our propositions."
44,4,April,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Divestment of relational assets following acquisitions: Evidence from the biopharmaceutical industry,"Vivek Tandon, Navid Asgari, Ram Ranganathan","We examine whether acquisitions affect the divestment of firms' alliance-based relational assets. Using data from the biopharmaceutical industry and a matched case–control research design, we find that alliances are more likely to be terminated following acquisitions compared to alliances not subject to acquisitions. This higher termination likelihood is driven by acquisitions where the acquirer's alliance management capacity is stressed, and by alliances inherited from targets. The inherited alliance effect is attenuated by the target's partner's common connections with the acquirer but amplified by the target's partner's unique connections outside the merging firms' alliance portfolios. These findings are consistent with our relational view-based theorizing on the post-acquisition challenges of retaining alliance-based assets, contributing to corporate strategy scholarship on alliances and acquisitions.","In many industries, firms' portfolios of interorganizational alliances enable them to realize novel complementarities and, thereby, enhance their performance. In such sectors, managers also frequently acquire other organizations to obtain access to critical resources. However, what managers may overlook is that acquisitions can destabilize existing alliance relationships. In this study, we show that the acquiring firm's capacity to effectively manage alliance-based assets is stressed once it inherits the target firm's alliances. In general, target firm alliances become more challenging to sustain, and, in particular, those that hold a higher potential for novelty become more unstable. Consequently, when evaluating acquisitions, managers should look beyond obvious measures of a target alliance's value and assess the post-acquisition integration challenges that may threaten its stability."
44,4,April,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Stronger together: Country-of-origin agglomeration and multinational enterprise location choice in an adverse institutional environment,"Yong Li, Jing Li, Peng Zhang, Sunhwan Gwon","Research suggests that multinational enterprises (MNEs) are attracted to locations with concentrated firms from the same home country to benefit from interactions with market forces, but it remains an open question whether such agglomeration facilitates MNEs' interactions with nonmarket actors such as the host government. We submit that since country-of-origin agglomeration can enable collective actions and create collective gains, colocation with compatriot firms will help MNEs navigate an adverse institutional environment. In line with this reasoning, we hypothesize that MNEs are more attracted to locations with country-of-origin agglomeration when MNEs face an exogenous shock that increases their regulatory burden in the host country. Our analysis offers corroborative evidence. The study adds to research on agglomeration, institutional environment, and location strategy.","Why do multinational enterprises (MNEs) locate near compatriot firms in a foreign location? The commonly recognized benefits include resource access and knowledge spillover from interactions with market forces such as suppliers and customers. We submit that colocation with compatriot firms can also help MNEs navigate an adverse institutional environment by generating “stronger-together” benefits. Colocation can enable collective actions and create collective gains for MNEs in their interactions with the host government. We find that after a diplomatic dispute, Korean MNEs are more attracted to locations in China that already have a cluster of Korean firms, whether in the same/related industries or in unrelated industries; this is particularly the case for small MNEs and in locations with weak institutions."
44,4,April,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,A cognitive perspective on real options investment: CEO overconfidence,"Joon Mahn Lee, Jung Chul Park, Guoli Chen","While real options theory has been applied with the optimality assumption, actual real options investments are made by managers, who are subject to cognitive biases, especially under uncertainty. In this article, we focus on one important type of cognitive bias, overconfidence, to provide new insights on real options literature. We argue that overconfident CEOs will invest less in real options than non-overconfident CEOs. We also predict that the relationship between overconfident CEOs and firms' real options intensity will be strengthened when market uncertainty is higher. In a study of U.S. public firms, we find strong support across various tests that use multiple measures of overconfidence in CEOs and real options investments, and control for potential selection issues and other endogeneity concerns.","This article studies how a CEO's cognitive bias, overconfidence, may shape a firm's real option investments, which could result in a different level of strategic flexibility. We argue that overconfident CEOs have overly high expectations of their performance under uncertainty and/or underestimate the level of uncertainty in their strategic decision-making, which leads to lower investments in the firms' real options relative to non-overconfident CEOs. We study a sample of U.S. public firms and find strong evidence that an overconfident CEO is positively related to the real options investments at the firm level. We also find that this overconfidence effect becomes more pronounced in markets with greater uncertainty."

We replicate H&Q's study, apply their CiC technique to a much more comprehensive U.S. sample, and assess the sensitivity of the model findings to variations in method and data. We generally confirm H&Q's finding of a high CEO effect, but find a smaller industry effect and a larger firm effect in our much larger sample. Applying the CiC technique with adjusted R2s has only a moderate impact on year, industry, and firm effects, but markedly reduces the CEO effect. We also document that CiC model findings are sensitive to sample characteristics, namely firm size and CEO tenure.","Hambrick and Quigley (2014) introduced a new method to analyze the influence of CEOs on firm performance. The study's empirical analysis focused on large U.S. firms. We replicate the original study and extend it to a much larger, comprehensive sample of U.S. firms that is composed of 33,996 firm-year observations, compared to 4,866 firm-years in the original study. Controlling for the number of variables used in the estimations, the model attributes about a third of the total variance of firm performance (ROA) to the CEO. Further analyses show that the model findings differ for firms of different size and CEO tenure; the larger the firms and the longer the CEO tenures, the smaller tends to be the percentage of variance explained by the CEO."

In doing so, we collate and discuss key articles published in the journals of the Strategic Management Society which, considered together, shed new light on processes of ecosystem emergence and evolution.

An empirical investigation of market returns surrounding the disclosure of politician stock purchases,"Mirzokhidjon Abdurakhmonov, Roary E. Snider, Jason W. Ridge, Dinesh Hasija","We investigate how congressional stock purchases may impact investor expectations of firm outcomes. Specifically, we argue that because there is information asymmetry regarding how public policy may impact a firm and investors perceive that members of the U.S. Congress possess insider governmental information and power over the regulatory landscape of a firm, a legislator's purchase of firm stock will generate abnormal returns. Furthermore, we argue that this response will be greater if the Congressperson has jurisdiction over the firm through committee assignments, and that the effect of jurisdiction will be strongest when the firm ties itself directly to the politician through political strategies (e.g., lobbying sponsored legislation, committee testimony, and political action committee contributions). We find support for many of our arguments in a broad sample of senator stock purchases between 2012 and 2020.",We examine stock purchases of the members of the U.S. Senate for years 2012–2020 and find that stock purchases by senate members generate abnormal returns. We also find that abnormal returns are higher if the senator has direct jurisdiction over the firm through committee assignments. We see an increase in abnormal returns if the firm is tied to the member of the U.S. Senate through lobbying-sponsored legislation and political action committee contributions. We also find that stocks both purchased and sold by senators experience negative abnormal returns over the 6–12 months following the transaction date. Our study provides insights into important public policy questions related to transparency and ethics in government and speaks to the question of investments by public servants.
44,5,May,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Corporate social counterpositioning: How attributes of social issues influence competitive response,"Aharon Mohliver, Donal Crilly, Aseem Kaul","Whilst existing research generally assumes corporate social responsibility (CSR) is seen as universally positive, firms increasingly adopt practices, and take stands, on highly polarizing social issues (e.g., gun-control, LGBTQ rights, abortion). To better understand this phenomenon, we develop a theory about when firms will emulate, ignore, or oppose each other's CSR efforts, based on attributes of the underlying social issue (its salience and polarization), the level of market competition, and the substantiveness of CSR. Our theory predicts several distinct equilibrium outcomes, including the potential for social counter-positioning, whereby rival firms take advantage of socio-political polarization to horizontally differentiate by taking opposing stances on a polarizing issue. Counterpositioning is more likely when salience is high, but agreement is low, when markets are competitive, and when CSR is largely symbolic.","Firms increasingly find themselves drawn, willingly or not, to taking stances on a controversial social issue (e.g., gun rights, abortion), though doing so risks alienating (some) stakeholders. In this paper, we develop a theory of why, when, and how firms should take a stance on a polarizing issue. We argue that firms profit from doing so when (1) the issue is salient, (2) markets are competitive, and (3) the actions are mostly symbolic. We also show that taking a stance on polarizing issues creates opportunities for the firms' competitors to counter their ideological positioning, strengthening weaker rivals in the process. Thus, in competitive markets, taking clear stances on polarizing, salient issues can segment the market, increasing the profits of all firms, and, potentially, intensifying polarization."
44,5,May,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,Cascading innovation: R&D team design and performance implications of mobility,Melody H. Chang,"Given the high cost of external hiring and uncertainty related to performance benefits, how can organizations foster an environment that maximizes the post-mobility performance of external hires and their collaborators? In this article, I posit that R&D team design is an important factor that could shape the post-mobility performances of both groups. Building on the interfirm mobility, innovation, and teams literatures, I argue that technological knowledge diversity within teams and across teams could differently impact innovation performance. Analyzing 63,976 interfirm moves of engineers and scientists, I find that the post-mobility performances of external hires and teammates are conditioned by team design. A high level of within-team diversity improves the performances of both groups, while a high level of across-team diversity hurts their innovation outcomes.","In the war for talent, firms often offer premium wages to source external hires. Yet there have been unclear expectations about the post-mobility outcomes of these hires and the implications for team performance. To better assess the value of hiring, managers should look beyond the performance of external hires and also consider team member performance. In the context of knowledge production activities, external hires, on average, experience an improvement in innovation performance after they move. Working with an external hire reduces the productivity of immediate collaborators but leads to more breakthrough innovations with greater technological impact. Most importantly, the performances of external hires and their teammates can be further improved by effectively designing R&D teams. Recomposing teams such that a high level of diversity exists within a team but minimal divergence across teams creates an environment that appears to enhance post-mobility innovation activities."
44,5,May,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,A rivalry-based theory of gender diversity,"John Kenneth Mawdsley, Lionel Paolella, Rodolphe Durand","We offer a rivalry-based perspective of gender diversity as a form of competitive action. We theorize that a firm adjusts its senior-level female representation when they identify business opportunities that may be seized by demonstrating alignment to gender parity expectations. Examining U.S. corporate law firms and potential buyers of their services, we theorize and find that when the buyers of rivals of the focal firm increase their gender diversity, the focal firm responds by increasing its female partner representation. Reinforcing the strategic approach to managing gender diversity, we also show that a focal firm reduces its gender-related response to rivals' buyers as the opportunity to attract those buyers decreases, and when the focal firm can use racial diversity as a credible substitute for gender diversity.",Do firms increase senior level gender diversity for normative or competitive reasons? We examine this question and test whether firms adjust their gender diversity to align with the gender diversity values of their competitors' clients. Our study shows that U.S. corporate law firms increase their level of female partners when the clients of their stronger competitors increase gender diversity in their executive rank. We also show that firms' gender diversity response weakens when there is a lower probability of luring those clients and when firms can offer racial diversity as a credible alternative signal of pro-diversity values. Our competitive-based view of gender diversity encourages managers to consider how and when proactive gender diversity improvement can be a mechanism for improving their firms' market position.
44,5,May,2023,RESEARCH SUMMARY,"Hitting reset: Industry evolution, generational technology cycles, and the dynamic value of firm experience","Hakan Ozalp, J.P. Eggers, Franco Malerba","We study how the value of depth and breadth of experience shifts across generational technology cycles and industry evolution. Experience breadth builds organizational flexibility that is valuable during technology transitions and when the industry is younger, while experience depth builds domain-specific resources that are important during periods of technology stability and later periods of industry evolution. We test our theory in the console game industry, where publishers face repeated periods of transition and stability across multiple console generations. We find support for most hypotheses, except that the value of breadth correlates with the magnitude of any transition instead of decreasing linearly over time. We contribute to research on the changing value of firm experience and to the understanding of generational technological change during industry evolution.","Many industries face generational changes. How incumbent firms handle those transitions is important to firm survival and success. We study how the prior experience of video game publishers helps them navigate transitions. First, we find that firms with deep experience in a genre produce more successful games in that genre only during stable periods in the industry. Second, the benefits of deep experience increase over time as some of the experience-built capabilities of the firm survive technological transitions. Third, broad and diversified firms perform best during generational transitions as they successfully enter new domains made popular by the generational shift. We suggest that the product strategies of video game firms should depend on the relevant experience they possess and the degree of environmental change."

Avolio, Wei Shen, David Waldman","As important stakeholders of a firm, employees are critical to firm success because they are directly engaged in strategy implementation. Accordingly, we theorize that employees' views can impact assessment of the CEO by the board of directors beyond firm financial performance and security analysts' recommendations. Specifically, we hypothesize that employee approval of a CEO's leadership is predictive of the board's CEO dismissal decision, particularly when there is relatively higher firm financial performance, more positive security analyst recommendations, and lower CEO power. Using longitudinal data from 338 firms and 1,252 firm-year observations between 2010 and 2018, we found empirical support for the above predictions. Our theory and supportive findings have important implications for research and practice regarding employee engagement, strategic leadership, and corporate governance.","Because employees are important stakeholders of a firm and critical to its success, we argue that their views about the CEO can impact how the board of directors evaluates the CEO beyond firm financial performance and security analysts' recommendations. Our results show that higher employee approval of CEO leadership (measured by data collected from Glassdoor.com over multiple years) negatively predicts CEO dismissal, particularly when the firm performs better financially, gets more positive recommendations from security analysts, and the CEO has less power relative to the board. These findings suggest that employees' views do matter in the retention or dismissal of the CEO, and that CEOs should be mindful of how their employees view their leadership and the strategies they are promoting at their firms."
